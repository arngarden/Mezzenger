# Mezzenger
### Simple and fast messaging/event system based on ZeroMQ

Mezzenger is a simple messaging system written in Python using ZeroMQ as backend.
It supports sending messages, (really any kind of Python-object that can be pickled), from one or more publishers to one or more subscribers through a server.

## Requirements
ZeroMQ - www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software

Python binding for ZeroMQ - www.zeromq.org/bindings:python

## Quick start
### Server
```
python mezzenger_server.py --bind='127.0.0.1'
```
Start a mezzenger_server that binds on IP 127.0.0.1.

### Client 1 (publisher)
```python
import time, random
import mezzenger_client
mc = mezzenger_client.Mezzenger(server_address='127.0.0.1', auto_start=False)
people = ['John', 'David', 'Lucy']
while True:
  mc.send_message('greetings', 'Hello %s!' % random.choice(people))
  time.sleep(3)
```
Create mezzenger client that connects to the server on 127.0.0.1. Since this client only sends messages we can set auto_start=False to prevent it from starting the thread that listens to new messages.

The client then starts sending random greetings to every other client that listens to the channel 'greetings'.

### Client 2 (subscriber)
```python
import mezzenger_client

def callback(payload, msg_obj):
  print payload
  
mc = mezzenger_client.Mezzenger(server_address='127.0.0.1')
mc.subscribe('greetings', callback)
```
Start mezzenger_client that subscribes to all 'greetings' and prints the greeting.


## The server - mezzenger_server.py
All messages are sent through the MezzengerServer which of course needs to run on a server that is accessible to all clients.

The server is easily started with 'python mezzenger_server.py'. The following command line arguments are available:
```
usage: mezzenger_server.py [-h] [--bind BIND_ADDRESS] [--pub-port PUB_PORT]
                           [--recv-port RECV_PORT]
                           [--persist-file PERSIST_FILE] [--verbose]

Mezzenger server

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --bind BIND_ADDRESS   Address to bind server on. Default is 127.0.0.1.
  --pub-port PUB_PORT   Port for outgoing messages. Default is 7201.
  --recv-port RECV_PORT
                        Port for incoming messages. Default is 7202.
  --persist-file PERSIST_FILE
                        Path to file where to save persistant messages.
                        Default is None, (no persist file is used).
  --verbose             Print verbose messages. Default is False.
```
The parameters bind, pub_port and recv_port are used for determining which address and ports the server uses for receiving and sending messages.

Messages that are waiting to be acknowledged by a subscriber are by default only saved in memory. If we would like these messages to also be persisted to a file we can set a file name in the parameter persist_file.

## The client - mezzenger_client.py
The client is used for sending and subscribing to messages. The Mezzenger-class takes the following arguments:
```
server_address - Address that the server is bound to. Default is 127.0.0.1.
send_port - Port for outgoing messages. Default is 7202.
sub_port - Port for incoming messages. Default is 7201.
send_timeout - Number of seconds the client tries sending message to server on each retry. Default is 2 seconds.
connection_retries - Number of connection retries that is made if the server is unresponsive before throwing exception. Default is 5
auto_start - If False, the listening thread is not started, useful if client is only used for sending messages. Default is True.
verbose - If True, status information is printed.
```
You send messages by calling the send_message method:
```python
def send_message(self, msg_name, payload, ack=0)
```
'msg_name' is the name of the message that is used by subscribers to filter it.
'payload' is the message payload.
'ack' denotes whether the server should demand an acknowledgement from a subscriber that the message has been received.

For subscribing to a message you use the subscribe method:
```python
def subscribe(self, msg_name, callback)
```
'msg_name' is the name of the message to subscribe to.
'callback' is a function that is called when a message is received. The function should accept two argument, the message payload and the complete message object.

For unsubscribing to a message you use the unsubscribe method:
```python
def unsubscribe(self, msg_name)
```

Before exiting your program or shutting down mezzenger_client you should call `mc.stop()` to make sure all threads exits.

## Message object
The message object that is sent as second argument to the callback function has the following members:
```python
name - The name of the message.
payload - The message payload, i.e the 'body'.
ack - 1 if server expects an ack, 0 otherwise.
timestamp - Unix-timestamp from when message was created.
checksum - MD5 checksum of message.
```

## Sending messages
A message has two parts, a name and a payload. The name should be an ordinary string (note that the pipe-symbol "|" can not be used in a message name). The payload can be any Python object that can be pickled.
To send a message with name 'greeting' and payload 'Hello Gustav!' we write:
```python
mc = mezzenger_client.Mezzenger()
mc.send_message('greeting', 'Hello Gustav!')
```
This message reaches all subscribers that are currently subscribing to messages with the name 'greeting'. If there are no such subscribers, the message is simply discarded by default.

If we are sending more important messages we might want to make sure that it reaches a subscriber. We can then set the ack-argument to 1, for example:
```python
mc.send_message('greeting', 'Hello Gustav!', ack=1)
```
When ack=1 the server will keep resending the message until at least one subscriber has acknowledged it. The ack is sent automatically from the client after the callback has returned.

By default the server keeps unacknowledged messages in memory so if the server crashes, the messages are lost. For extra protection you can give a name to a file where the unacknowledged messages should be persisted. This is done by settings the persist_file-parameter to the name of the file when starting the server.

Note that there is currently no way of limiting the number of saved messages so it is possible to fill all available memory if you are not careful.
