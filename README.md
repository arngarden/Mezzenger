# Mezzenger
### Simple messaging/event system based on ZeroMQ

Mezzenger is a simple messaging system written in Python using ZeroMQ as backend.
It supports sending messages, (really any kind of Python-object that can be pickled), from one or more publishers to one or more subscribers through a server.


## Quick start
### Server
```
python mezzengerServer.py --bind='127.0.0.1'
```
Start a mezzengerServer that binds on IP 127.0.0.1.

### Client 1 (publisher)
```python
import time, random
import mezzengerClient
mc = mezzengerClient.Mezzenger(serverAddress='127.0.0.1', autoStart=False)
people = ['John', 'David', 'Lucy']
while True:
  mc.sendMessage('greetings', 'Hello %s!' % random.choice(people))
  time.sleep(3)
```
Create mezzenger client that connects to the server on 127.0.0.1. Since this client only sends messages we can set autoStart=False to prevent it from starting the thread that listens to new messages.
The client then starts sending random greetings to every other client that listens to the channel 'greetings'.

### Client 2 (subscriber)
```python
import mezzengerClient

def callback(msg):
  print msg
  
mc = mezzengerClient.Mezzenger(serverAddress='127.0.0.1')
mc.subscribe('greetings', callback)
```
Start mezzengerClient that subscribes to all 'greetings' and prints the greeting.


## The server - mezzengerServer.py
All messages are sent through the MezzengerServer which of course needs to run on a server that is accessible to all clients.
The server is easily started with 'python mezzengerServer.py'. The following command line arguments are available:
```
usage: mezzengerServer.py [-h] [--bind BINDADDRESS] [--pubPort PUBPORT]
                          [--recvPort RECVPORT] [--persistFile PERSISTFILE]
                          [--debug]

Mezzenger server

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --bind BINDADDRESS    Address to bind server on. Default is 127.0.0.1.
  --pubPort PUBPORT     Port for outgoing messages. Default is 7201.
  --recvPort RECVPORT   Port for incoming messages. Default is 7202.
  --persistFile PERSISTFILE
                        Path to file where to save persistant messages.
                        Default is None, (no persist file is used).
  --debug               Print debug messages. Default is False.
```
The parameters bind, pubPort and recvPort are used for determining which address and ports the server uses for receiving and sending messages.
Messages that are waiting to be acknowledged by a subscriber are by default only saved in memory. If we would like these messages to also be persisted to a file we can set a file name in the parameter persistFile.

## The client - mezzengerClient.py
The client is used for sending and subscribing to messages. The Mezzenger-class has the following arguments:
```
serverAddress - Address that the server is bound to. Default is 127.0.0.1.
sendPort - Port for outgoing messages. Default is 7202.
subPort - Port for incoming messages. Default is 7201.
sendTimeout - Number of seconds the client tries sending message to server on each retry. Default is 2 seconds.
connectionRetries - Number of connection retries that is made if the server is unresponsive before throwing exception.
autoStart - If False, the listening thread is not started, useful if client is only used for sending messages. Default is True.
verbose - If True, status information is printed.
```
You send messages by calling the sendEvent method:
```python
def sendMessage(self, msgName, msg, ack=0)
```
'msgName' is the name of the message that is used by subscribers to filter it.
'msg' is the message payload.
'ack' denotes whether the server should demand an acknowledgement from a client that the message has been received.

For subscribing to a message you use the subscribe method:
```python
def subscribe(self, msgName, callback)
```
'msgName' is the name of the message to subscribe to.
'callback' is a function that is called when a message is received. The function should accept only one argument, the message payload.

## Sending messages
A message has two parts, a name and a payload. The name should be an ordinary string (note that the pipe-symbol "|" can not be used in a message name). The payload can be any Python object that can be pickled.
To send a message with name 'greeting' and payload 'Hello Gustav!' we write:
```python
mc = mezzengerClient.Mezzenger()
mc.sendMessage('greeting', 'Hello Gustav!')
```
This message reaches all subscribers that are currently subscribing to messages with the name 'greeting'. If there are no such subscribers, the message is simply discarded.
